						We retain your account information (email, name, location), billing details, and usage data for as
						long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you delete your account,
						we will delete or anonymize your information, unless we need to retain certain information for
						legitimate business or legal purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						To request deletion of your account and personal data, please email us at privacy@luminapdf.xyz.
						We will process your request within 30 days.
